# üé≤ Falling Cubes with Three.js
this is a fun little 3D scene created with Three.js where colorful cubes fall from the sky, bounce off the floor, and spin around.

## üõ†Ô∏è How It Works

### Setting Up the Scene
created a camera with a nice wide view and position it to see the whole scene:
```javascript
camera = new THREE.PerspectiveCamera(70, window.innerWidth / window.innerHeight, 1, 10000);
camera.position.z = 5000;
```

### Floor
- Creates a large floor using a plane geometry and a standard material.
- Rotates it to lie flat and positions it 1000 units below the origin.
- Enables it to receive shadows.
```javascript
const floorGeometry = new THREE.PlaneGeometry(10000, 10000);
const floorMaterial = new THREE.MeshStandardMaterial({ color: 0xffffff, side: THREE.DoubleSide });
const floor = new THREE.Mesh(floorGeometry, floorMaterial);
floor.rotation.x = Math.PI / 2;
floor.position.y = -1000;
floor.receiveShadow = true;
scene.add(floor);
```

### Cubes
(line 38) excluded for brevity
- Creates 120 cubes with random colors, positions, and rotation speeds.
- Adds each cube to the scene and an array for tracking.

### Lighting
- Adds a directional light to simulate sunlight and enable shadows.
- Configures shadow properties for realism.
- Adds ambient light for basic illumination.
```javascript
light = new THREE.DirectionalLight(0xffffff, 1);
light.position.set(0, 4000, 2000);
light.castShadow = true;
light.shadow.mapSize.width = 1024;
light.shadow.mapSize.height = 1024;
scene.add(light);

light.shadow.camera.near = 0.5;
light.shadow.camera.far = 10000;
light.shadow.camera.left = -5000;
light.shadow.camera.right = 5000;
light.shadow.camera.top = 5000;
light.shadow.camera.bottom = -5000;

scene.add(new THREE.AmbientLight(0x404040));
```

### Animate()
code excluded for brevity
- Applies gravity to each cube.
- Checks for collisions with the floor and makes the cubes bounce.
- Adds rotation to each cube.
